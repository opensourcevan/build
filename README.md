# Open Source Van Build (WIP)

## Contents

These are the plans for a van build in a RAM Promaster. This build is broken out into 22 phases; each with an associated cost and duration. Each phase has common questions and answers, a part list, and the build steps.

## Values

### Sustainability
I want the materials I use to be environmentally friendly and support companies with values I support. I want to minimize my use of water and  gas and power my devices 100% from the sun.

### Modularity
I want to be able to completely disassemble the van and sell it as a cargo van if I decide to pause van life or buy a different vehicle.

### Accessibility

I want people to use this as a guide to build their own van and to clearly understand the duration and cost of a similar project before they commit.
