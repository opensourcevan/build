# Phase 4 - Struts

## Overview

I installed wooden struts to mount future modules to the walls of the van.

## Q&A

#### Why use wooden struts instead attaching modules directly to the ribs of the van?

Many modules will be made of aluminum framing. I don't want to create a thermal bridge between the framing and the van metal. By "insulating" the aluminum framing with wooden struts, the aluminum framing can retain its heat.
