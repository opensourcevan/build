# Phase 1 - Roof

## Overview

I installed 540W of 24V solar panels and two Maxx Air fans. To install the solar panels I mounted brackets and a solar wire junction box.

## Q&A

#### Why use 540 Watts of 24 Volt Solar?

At 540W 24V panels send a maximum of 22.5A at 24V to the solar charge controller. The solar charge controller converts this to 42.8A at 12.6V to charge the batteries. At this rate, in ideal conditions with no usage or loss, a 100Ah battery will charge from 0% to 100% in 2.3 hours.

#### Why use Maxx Air Fans?

I chose MaxxFans because they are remote controlled, bidirectional, rain proof, have multiple windspeed settings, and automatically turn on and off depending on temperature. I went for two fans so I could get airflow to all parts of the van.

## Steps

1. Mask out the panels, fans, and junction box.
    - Use painters tape to prevent paint removal.
    - Make the inside edge of the tape correspond to the cut line.
    - Ensure that there is enough room for the two fans, the solar panels, and the solar panel mounting bars.
    - Find a place on starboard side above the electrical hub to place the junction box. Find a place underneath the solar panels that enters the van near a rib. Make sure a hole will not compromise roof strength or interfere with the mounting bars or fans and mark it with painters tape.

2. Install the solar panel mounting bars.

3. Install the junction box.
    - Cut the 2x2 hole in the roof of the van.
    - Attach a wooden frame made from 1x2 spruce/pine boards to the inside of the van to provide strength to the hole.
    - Seal and screw the junction box to the roof of the van.

4. Install the MaxxFans.
    - For each fan, cut a 14x14 hole in the roof of the van.
    - Attach a wooden frame made from 1x2 spruce/pine boards to the inside of the van to provide strength to the hole.
    - Seal and screw the fans to the roof of the van.

5. Install the solar panels.
    - Mount the solar panels to the solar panel mounting bars.
    - Thread the wires through the junction box and down the rib of the van.

## Conclusion

This phase cost $730.90 and took ? hours.
